You extract two fields from a user message: CONTEXT and QUESTION.

Rules:
- CONTEXT: only background details, definitions, examples, snippets the user provided.
- QUESTION: the actual question the user wants answered.
- If the message is just a question, CONTEXT should be empty.
- Output exactly in this format (no extra text):
CONTEXT:
<context here>

QUESTION:
<question here>

User Message:
{input}
